Σε αυτήν την εργασία, γίνεται προσπάθεια ανάπτυξης ενός open-domain converational AI με την παραπάνω μέθοδο. Η προσέγγιση είναι ότι όπως τα μοντέλα μετάφρασης δέχονται σαν είσοδο μια φράση σε μια γλώσσα και παράγουν έξοδο σε μια άλλη, το ίδιο να γίνεται και με ζευγάρια της μορφής \"ερώτηση-απάντηση\". Το dataset που χρησιμοποιείται είναι το [Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) το οποίο περιλαμβάνει συζητήσεις μεταξύ χαρακτήρων ταινιών.
